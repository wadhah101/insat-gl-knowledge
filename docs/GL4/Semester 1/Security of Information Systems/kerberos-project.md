# Kerberos

Author [@rihemebh](https://github.com/rihemebh)

## What is Kerberos

Kerberos is a computer-network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner. Its designers aimed it primarily at a client–server model, and it provides mutual authentication—both the user and the server verify each other's identity. Kerberos protocol messages are protected against eavesdropping and replay attacks.

## Architecture

## What we will do ?

You will find in this repo a flask endpoint that needs kerberos authentication.

In order to test it you need to configure 3 machines : KDC, Client and Server then generate a token from the ticket produced by the KDC and everything will work properly

--Note: in the rest of this document I will only use 2 machines one for the KDC and the other will work as server and client

## Prerequisite

- Docker
- Ubuntu image
- Python3
- Flask and Flask-Kerberos

## How it works?

1. Pull docker image : `docker pull ubuntu`
2. Create network bridge to create a private netwok between containers so they can communicate with each others : `docker network create --driver=bridge <network name>`
3. Create 2 containers from that image

Since the image doesn’t have any pre-installed dependencies you should first run :

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade
```

then install whatever you need (in our case we'll need: nano, host, ntp, ntpdate, python3, python3-pip )

## Machines' Setup

We will use `insat.tn` as domain name.

1. In each machine match different ips to their sub domain name in `/etc/hosts`

   ```bash
   172.21.0.2 kdc.insat.tn kdc
   172.21.0.3 server.insat.tn server
   ```

   To test if everything is working properly try this command on each sub-domain:

   ```bash
   host kdc.insat.tn
   ```

2. Synchronize date between machines with ntp and ntpdate :

   - Why ?

     - Kerberos is time sensitive. It uses timestamps mechanism to check the validity of a ticket.Thus, we will create our own time server and synchronize all the machines.

   - On the Kdc machine edit the `/etc/ntp.conf` and add the lines below:

   ```bash
   restrict 127.0.0.1
   restrict ::1
   restrict 192.168.56.110 mask 255.255.255.0
   nomodify notrap
   server 127.127.1.0 stratum 10
   listen on *
   ```

   - On the server install ntp and ntpdate:

   ```bash
   apt install ntp
   apt install ntpdate
   ```

   - then edit the `/etc/ntp.conf` and add the lines below:

   ```bash
   pool ntp.ubuntu.com
   server 192.168.56.110
   server obelix
   ```

   - Synchronize time by running the below command on the server machine:

   ```bash
   ntpdate -dv 192.168.56.110
   ```

3. Configure KDC

```bash
apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server krb5-config
```

When it's prompted : -> realm : INSAT.TN -> kerberos server : kdc.insat.tn -> Administrative Service: kdc.insat.tn

- Create the realm: A Kerberos realm is the domain over which a Kerberos authentication server has the authority to authenticate a user, host or service.

```bash
krb5_newrealm
```

- Create principals and generate keytab:
  - A Kerberos Principal represents a unique identity in a Kerberos system to which Kerberos can assign tickets to access Kerberos-aware services.
  - The Kerberos Keytab file contains mappings between Kerberos Principal names and DES-encrypted keys that are derived from the password used to log into the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC).

```bash
kadmin.local
addprinc root/admin
addprinc -randkey host/kdc.example.tn
ktadd host/kdc.example.tn
```

### 4. Configure Server

```bash
apt install krb5-user libpam-krb5 libpam-ccreds
```

Then do the same thing for realm, kerberos service, administrative service

- Add host :

```bash
kadmin
addprinc -randkey host/server.insat.tn
ktadd host/server.insat.tn
```

- Install Flask and Flask-Kerberos with pip

```bash
pip install flask
```

If you are using a docker image you should run those commands before installing flask kerberos:

```bash
apt-get install libkrb5-dev
apt-get install krb5-config
apt-get install libkrb5-dev
apt-get install libsasl2-dev
apt-get install libsasl2-modules-gssapi-mit
pip install requests_kerberos

pip install flask_kerberos
```

=> Now your machines are ready to use the flask service

## Integrating Kerberos to a Flask Endpoint

Since Kerberos is based on ticket granting and not passwords so we need first to grant a ticket for the user to access the service

### Tickets

We have 2 types of tickets

- TGT (ticket granting ticket) : the ticket that will allow you to get tickets for services
- TGS (ticket granting service) allow you to access a service secured by kerberos

### Steps

In order to test the endpoint you need to follow these steps:

1. Generate a ticket : `kinit`.
2. Get the List of tickets with some details about them like expiration date : `klist`.
3. Change the diffrent domain names in files "requestHandler" and "index" with your ones.
4. Run the server `./index.py`
5. Execute the requestHandler.py file : its role is to generate a negotiate token and add the header to the url.
